# Dockerized continuous integration

## Docker Engine
[Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) is required to build and run docker images.  
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) makes Dockerfile management easier and is required to run docker-compose files.  

See [Wiki](https://github.com/IoTitude/docker_test_env/wiki) for details.
